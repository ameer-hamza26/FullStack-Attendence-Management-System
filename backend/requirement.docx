‚úÖ Structure: Complete and well-organized
‚úÖ Routes: Defined and connected
‚úÖ Models: Created with proper schemas
‚úÖ Middleware: JWT authentication ready
‚ùå Controllers: Only placeholder functions (need implementation)
ÔøΩÔøΩ Where to Start - Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Authentication (Start Here!)
Priority: HIGH - Everything else depends on this
Implement authController.js:
register() function with password hashing
login() function with JWT token generation
Input validation and error handling
Test authentication endpoints:
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
Phase 2: User Management
Priority: MEDIUM
Implement userController.js:
getUsers() - Admin only, get all users
deleteUser() - Admin only, delete user
Add role-based authorization
Phase 3: Attendance System
Priority: MEDIUM
Implement attendanceController.js:
markAttendance() - User marks their attendance
getAttendance() - User views their own attendance
getAllAttendance() - Admin views all attendance
Phase 4: Additional Features
Priority: LOW
Add more routes:
User profile updates
Attendance reports
Date range filtering
üéØ Recommended Starting Point
Start with authController.js - implement the registration and login functions. This is the foundation that everything else builds upon.
Would you like me to:
Implement the authentication controller with full registration/login logic?
Add input validation and error handling?
Create test endpoints to verify everything works?
